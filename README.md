# pmlc_nova
This module is for basic nova management.  It was written to provide basic config changes to nova via the Fuel master.  It is not intended to be a fully-functional openstack/nova configuration management module to deploy nova from scratch.  It is merely to allow config changes and ensure nova services are running after deploying with Fuel.

## Controllers
